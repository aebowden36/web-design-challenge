This assignment consisted of creating a visualization dashboard consisting of seven different pages:
a landing page giving a synopsis of the data analysis conducted on the given dataset, one page for each of four analyses conducted, a comparisons page showing all of the graphs so that they can each be visually compared, and a data page displaying a table containing the original dataset.
